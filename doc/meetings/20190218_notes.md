**General vision:**

2. Based on the questioner you get a score which you improve daily.
3. Eco-activities can be registered in the end of the day or when you turn on the app.
4. They give you points **and** some in-game currency which can be spent.
5. There is an event tab, where you can see some eco related events near you (google API).
6. Tab for tips on improving your carbon emission.
7. Design:![](https://i.imgur.com/XPsp4SB.jpg)
