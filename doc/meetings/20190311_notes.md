Main issue: Merge GUI and Database

Everybody seems to be on track but connecting the GUI and database is necessary to get a sufficient demo 


Main things to do:
- Priority: Finish everything for the next demo
-   
 
2. Is everyone satisfied with our work? What would you suggest to improve/reconfigure/change in order to reach better end product?
    Everybody seems to be on track but connecting the GUI and database is necessary to get a sufficient demo 

3. Discuss if we are moving towards our main goal (demo 2).
If we get the DB/GUI interaction going we will take a big leap and be very close to a working demo version
4. If so, create a plan on what is left to do to reach it. If not, figure out why and create a new plan  
that moves towards the main goal.
After we manage to merge GUI/master we can start testing the interaction and resolve any issues if they occur.
5. Merge GUI branch with master! 
6. Add new issues to the board immediately.
Issues have been added
