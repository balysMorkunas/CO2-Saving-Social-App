NEXT WEEK To Do (Monday 02/18/2019):

1. Discuss what we individually researched about:
    - Carbon footprint calculations.
    - API's and how to implement them.
    - Whatever interesting or useful you found.
    - Make an idea bank from all of this information.
2. Write down what we **HAVE** to implement and what we want to add as a bonus (for this one must have read the Rubric)
3. Start generalising our product (what we want, how it looks, **so that everyone sees the same vision and agrees upon it!**)
4. Start to think about how it works. 
    - Decide on what gui (JavaFX?) to use.
    - How the client communicates with the server, how we are going to implement that. 
    - Should we set up a database or not, if so, how and what should we use.
    - Ask TA for tips, where to start, if we are missing something.
