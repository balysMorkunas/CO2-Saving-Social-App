### Agenda
---
1. Have a sprint review:  
    a. Discuss what had to be done.  
    b. How it went? Did each member accomplish his goals? If no, why not?      
    c. Any blocking issues?  
2. Let each memeber tell what are they doing now if anything, any new ideas?
3. Discuss the next main goal (probably the demo).
4. Create a sprint plan for it.
5. Add issues immediately.
