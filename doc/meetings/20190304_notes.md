**Present: Everyone**

The main difficulties we can across was spending too much time on trivial things.
While some components of the program were done they were dependent 
on another one, which was not yet finished and this led to postponing 
the testing of functionality.

Main things to do:
'1.' Work on the graphical features on the main screen, and decide what style to apply
'2.' Work with Spring Security, tokenizing sessions
3. Put finishing touches to login and sign up screen
4. Implement the database entities and relationships in JPA
5. Devise steps for the workflow of adding vegetarian meal to the activites



The sprint plan needs to be in the agenda next time.
We need to upload the checkstyle and coverage results to gitlab before monday next week.
