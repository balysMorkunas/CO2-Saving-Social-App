20190401 Meeting. Chairman: Nikola, Notes: Balys.

Notes

#### What we did?
We all achieved our tasks and reached the third demo. The only problem was that I accidentally pushed to master and things
messed up. Had to revert the changes but we did not have premission. It was fixed after our TA helped us. We did the 
demo on master still. We reverted all necessary changes after and it now works fine.


#### What to do?:

1. Clean up the description text fields to actually add the description, not only the amounts.
2. Private profile (important).
3. The achievement pop-up that tells you that you got it.
4. Display a tag/badge when you get it. 
5. Ability to upvote a post.
6. Show pictures of news feed. 
7. Get the last items working from the activities. 
8. Profile image.
9. Report draft for Thursday.

The board has been updated with more explicit issues.
