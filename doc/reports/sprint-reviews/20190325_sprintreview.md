*Meeting 2019/03/25  
Chairman: Wessel, Notes: Balys.*

### Review of Sprint 4
---

Wessel - Set up password recovery with a new HTML.
Alexander - Social button with follow/unfollow functionality
Balys - News feed and leader board.
Luuk - Changing the FXML to resize properly.
Ka Fui - Did necessary methods for the follow/unfollow server side. 

Everyone accomplished what they wanted but we used the time to focus on design and other side stuff, but not the demo.  
So this week we will focus mainly on the demo.  
Then on other stuff like email-verification, private-profile, profile picture, fxml resizing, news-feed update.


In general this week was productive and the GUI was updated a lot. None complaints were discussed  
so I guess we are satisfied.
