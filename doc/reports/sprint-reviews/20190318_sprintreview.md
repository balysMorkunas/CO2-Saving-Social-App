*Meeting 2019/03/18.  
Chairman: Wessel, Note-taker: Ka Fui.*

### Review of sprint 3:
Balys
I think I have succeeded at the task that needed to be done for this sprint week. Also the demo was done before deadline. 
The time to do the job was less than expected. Disgusting everything before actually coding. Every project mate that work on the server should review the code
before merging and every project mate that work on the GUI should review the code before merging.

Luuk
The gui was finally merge with database and the master. The login screen implementation wise is finished. We should focus on the core feature.

Ka Fui
I am not satisfied with my task because I tried to write the methods for getfoodlog and setfoodlog but they were not suboptimal. So they were changed by other
group mates. I wanted to also write test but didn't succeed. More time invested in the task than expected because of knowledge in testing the server side.

Alex
I think I spent too much time on things like the interconnectivity with server and the GUI. Took more time than necessary. Not 
satisfied because the code was not effective or the codes were too long. I suggest that we do some more code reviewing. The GUI project mates should review
each other codes and the server project mate should review each other codes. During the week we should show what we have done before this meeting. 

Niko
I am not satisfied with my work. I think we need a common mindset. Some group mates are not up to date. Implementaton of GUI and database schema was
different. Main issue is communication and we should stick to one thing.

Wessel
I added the test for the server and the client. In the client test the server is mocked. In the server the embedded database is mocked. I am satisfied for this
week. The server side took longer than expected.
