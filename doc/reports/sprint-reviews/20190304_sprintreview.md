Sprint review of WEEK 2:

## General thoughts:

We seemed pleased with our current work, everyone is participating and that is whats most important in our opinion.  
All of the work that was planned was completed.
## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: We are blocking each other.

Some issues could not be completed before others, thus some team members had to wait.  
To mitigate this for now we have agreed on being more communicative and try to complete our work faster.
If this does not work we want to start using Priority functionality in GitLab.
