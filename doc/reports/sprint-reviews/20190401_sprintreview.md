*2019/04/01 Meeting Sprint review:*

### General notes:
---
We all achieved our tasks and reached the third demo. The only problem was that I accidentally pushed to master and things
messed up. Had to revert the changes but we did not have premission. It was fixed after our TA helped us. We did the 
demo on master still. We reverted all necessary changes after and it now works fine.
